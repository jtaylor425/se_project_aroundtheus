**Intro**

This project was a part of the adaptive web design sprint and taught the essential skills for creating layouts with HTML and CSS and using tools like Figma and VSCode. After completing this sprint I had the required skills and knowledge of an HTML/CSS Developer.

**Skills & Knowledge Acquired**

- **Project Requirements:** Used a Figma page to gather all project requirements instead of a PDF brief.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Adapted the page layout to popular screen sizes using media queries to rearrange elements at various max screen widths.
  - Avoided using absolute dimensions for blocks/elements, favoring relative dimensions (e.g., `max-width: 100%`, `minmax`, `auto`) to ensure the page layout naturally adjusts to desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions without text or images wrapping.
  - Prevented text wrapping using various CSS properties:
    - `text-overflow: ellipsis`
    - `white-space: nowrap`
    - `overflow: hidden`
- **Grid Layout:**
  - Effectively used `display: grid` CSS property to control page layouts for adaptive web design.
  - Utilized grid properties such as:
    - `grid-template-areas`
    - `grid-area`
    - `grid-template-columns/rows`
    - `grid-gap`
  - Applied grid design for both the cards section and the profile info block.
- **Custom Fonts:** Linked third-party fonts to the page using the `@font-face` rule to default the entire page to the Inter font at various font weights and styles.
